# The-Average-Semester

Every semester at Texas A&M, I remade my the schedule the university made me into a version that had a high resolution, dark theme, verticle, and had my work schedule. I save it on my phone to use as a quick reference.

During my last semester at A&M, I had a simple question: "What if I made a heatmap of all my schedules"? I figured it would be a fun data visualization project, and so I set out to do in 
[paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/), the same software I made remade my schdules in. And it turned out pretty good if I do say so myself:

*The left image was used as a proof of concept, with all 8 schedules staked ontop of one another. The right image is the heatmap*

While I think it turned out great, it doesn't work well as a data visualization tool unless you have the ability to click through the layers to see more detail.
So I made an HTML page for the color version and the heatmap version, and with some Javascript, was able to recreate the effect.
You can also see it in action on my personal website here: https://people.tamu.edu/~andywheir/projects/schedule/
